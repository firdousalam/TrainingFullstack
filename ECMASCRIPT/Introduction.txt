ECMAScript
ECMAScript is a language specification standardized by European Computer Manufacturers Association(ECMA).

All major JavaScript implementations adhere to the ECMAScript standard.

ECMAScript Defines

Language Syntax – parsing rules, keywords, statements, declarations, operators, etc.
Types – boolean, number, string, object, etc.
Prototypes and Inheritance
Standard Library of built-in objects and functions

Creating complex strings
Creating multiline strings no longer requires Backslash n (\n)

Creating a multiline string in JS:

let bio = "Wendy Harper \n Software Engineer - TCS \n 3 Years in Web development"
Creating the same in ES6

let bio = `Wendy Harper
           Software Engineer - TCS
           3 Years in Web development` 

ES6
ECMAScript6 or ES6 is the sixth edition of the ECMA script Language specification standard.

TC39, is the committee that drafts the ECMAScript specifications. 
They follow a yearly model for defining new standards, where new features are added as they are approved, 
rather than waiting till all features are ready. 
Thus ES7 will contain all features proposed and approved in 2016.

Look Out!
As a part of this ECMAScript 6 course, we'll be exploring:

Block scope (let and const)
Default, Rest and Spread parameters
Destructuring
Arrow Functions
Template Literals
ClassesandModules
Promise
Maps and Sets
Symbols
Transpiling
