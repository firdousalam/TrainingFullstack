Arrow functions in ES6 are the modified and abbreviated syntax of JavaScript functions.

These functions make use of => token and hence known as Fat Arrow functions.

Also, Arrow functions are less verbose than the traditional function expressions.

Arrow functions can also be used as function expressions to return object literals. The function body should be wrapped in parantheses () to achieve this.

Example in JavaScript

var bio = function(name, age, country) {
    return {name: name, age: age, country: country};              
};
Example in ES6

var bio = (name, age, country) => ({name: name, age: age, country: country})
