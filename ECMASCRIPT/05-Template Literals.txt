Template Literals

Template string makes it easy to create strings that are longer and have lot of dynamic content (variables) with exact amount of spaces, line breaks and indentation.

Template literals allows to:

Create complex strings easily.
Evaluate an expression in templates.
Build complex html and xml templates (template functions).
Instead of single quotes or double quotes, ES6 uses BACKTICK or OPENQUOTE ( " ` " ) character to create template literals.

Evaluating Expressions
The literal is delimited by backticks and the interpolated expressions inside the literal are delimited by ${ variable }.

Template literals always produce strings.

Example of interpolation of Expressions:

let fN = `Wendy`;
let lN = `Harper`;
console.log(`My name is ${fN} ${lN}`);  
Alternatively we can also use more complex object.

let person = {
    fN: `Wendy`,
    lN: `Harper`,
    name: function() {
        return `My name is ${this.fN} ${this.lN}`;
    }
};
person.name();
Output in both cases would be: My name is Wendy Harper


Creating HTML Templates
Without using any templating libraries such as moustache or handlebars, we can create templates using template literals, which can be reused.

const wendy = {  "id": 1,
                 "firstName": "Wendy", 
                 "lastName":  "Harper",
                 "city":      "Tulsa"
            }

function bio(person) {
return `<p>
    <h1>
        <span>${person.firstName}</span>
        <span>${person.lastName}</span>
     </h1>
        <address>${person.city}</address>
    </p>`
}
bio(wendy)
Output:

 <p>
    <h1>
        <span>Wendy</span>
        <span>Harper</span>
    </h1>
    <address>Tulsa</address>
</p>
